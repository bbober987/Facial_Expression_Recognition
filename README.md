# Facial_Expression_Recognition

I've been taking some courses in deep learning on Udemy (Lazy programmer's series). I'll be using the facial expression image dataset obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge) to test out different architectures and techniques as I learn them as a way to document my progress and solidify my learnings.
